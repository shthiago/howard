# HOWARD

HOWARD stands for HOme Worker And Reader of Detectors. This project is a small pratice on home automation, using some devices to collect information and take some actions.

(yes, the name is kind of a joke, I just can't think a better one that the initials can be read as a name that)

# Objectives

This project stands for a simple home "assistant", trying to collect some data from my house. Enumrating:

- Learn about frontend developing, create dashboards, etc
- Create some kind of monitoring system for my internet connection
- Learn the full process of developing a web application, from the data collecting and it's usage
- Understand authentication systems, creating one from scratches
- Try to create something nice with data collected
- Apply knowledge about IoT devices, just to not losing the skills with the time that I'm not working with it

## Stage 1: proof of concept

* [X] Integrate MongoDB

* [X] Create routine to monitoring internet connection

* [ ] Create a frontend

* [ ] Run server on a RPi 

* [ ] Create autodeploy (with Docker? Idk if RPi can run Docker ro if exists any image for ARM)


## Stage 2: swarm

* [ ] Create a API with endpoints to devices communicate with

* [ ] Create some nodes to read sensors and connect to server

## Stage 3: test that thing

* [ ] Create auth system
* [ ] Create tests (frontend)
* [ ] Create tests (backend)

## Stage 4: who knows?
